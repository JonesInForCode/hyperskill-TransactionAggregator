# My Project

This is a sample README file demonstrating how to insert code snippets.

## Inline Code

You can use `inline code` like this.

## Code Blocks

Here's a Python code block:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("GitHub"))
```

And here's a JavaScript code block:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("GitHub"));
```
